- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @avdenisse
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, design graphic, learning languages.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use PostgreSQL
- âš¡ Fun fact: I never though of being a programmer before. I want to expand my curriculum so I enrolled in a course at my university. That is how I discover my love for programming.
